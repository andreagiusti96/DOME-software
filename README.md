# DOME-software

This software allows the use of the [OME (Dynamic Optical Micro-Environment)](http://theopendome.org).
For more info about the DOME visit http://theopendome.org.

To start your first experiment with the DOME run `DOME_experiment.py` on the Raspberry Pi 4 connected to the camera.

## Features
  - Acquire images and video from the DOME camera (see `DOME_experiment.py`)
  - Project configurable and time varying light inputs and patterns (see `DOME_experiment.py`)
  - Automatic image analysis to detect and track the agents (see `DOME_tracker.py`)
  - Calibration to map the camera and the projector frames (see `DOME_calibration_camera_v2.py`)

## Main scripts
  - `DOME_experiment`: acquire video and images while controlling the projector. Use the console to input single commands or define an experiment as a sequence of actions. This is the main script to use the DOME.
  - `DOME_calibration`: automatic calibration of the camera-to-projector transformation.
  - `DOME_calibration_v2`: manual calibration of the camera-to-projector transformation.
  - `DOME_tracker`: reads the images acquired during an experiment to detect and track the agents.
  - `DOME_experiment_analysis`: analyse the data generated by DOME_tracker.

## Utility scripts
  - `DOME_graphics`: utility for plots and images manipulation.
  - `DOME_imaging_utilities`: utility to use the camera.
  - `DOME_communication`: utility to manage the wifi communication between the two Raspberries Pi.
  - `DOME_experiment_manager`: utility to manage the storage of data generated during an experiment.
  - `DOME_transformation`: utility to manage the camera-to-projector transformation and the projection of shapes.
  - `DOME_projection_interface`: to run on the Raspberry Pi connected to the projector. Recives the commands from the Raspberry Pi connected to the camera and controls the projector.
