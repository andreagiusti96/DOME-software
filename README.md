# DOME-software

This software allows the use of the DOME (Dynamic Optical Micro-Environment).
For more info about the DOME visit http://theopendome.org.

To start your first experiment with the DOME run DOME_experiment.py on the Raspberry Pi 4 connected to the camera.

Features:
  - Acquire images and video from the DOME camera (see DOME_experiment.py and DOME_microscope.py)
  - Project configurable and time varying light inputs and patterns (see DOME_experiment.py)
  - Automatic image analysis to detect and track the agents (see DOME_tracker.py)
  - Calibration to map the camera and the projector frames (see DOME_calibration_camera(_v2).py)
